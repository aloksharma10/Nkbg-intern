      <Horicariimg title="Our Vision" description="The aim of any good school should be to provide the best possible education to its students. Our primary aim is to develop in the students-qualities of integrity, honesty, trust, tolerance and compassion, to foster a scientific temper within the bonds of humanism, to help the student to become a meaningful part of his environment. The objective of the school is to assist the students to unfold their latent talents and to help them to grow to the highest possible level in as many fields as is possible for each individual. In addition to facilitating their physical, mental, spiritual, aesthetic and ethical growth the school invests them with an indomitable spirit. Our training here is geared to discovering their infinite worth as they grow up. It will be our endeavour to instill in them the quality of self-worth and they will be motivated in life to do the right thing." 
      p1="Our constant endeavour is to develop communication skills, leadership qualities and life skills such as problem solving, realistic goal setting, self-confidence, decision making, independent thought etc. For this purpose, wholesome activities like discussions, situations requiring independent thought are conceived and implemented. Such training opens the minds of children to a world beyond academia. Furthermore, they learn to face challenges. Briefly, we are imparting mind-enhancing education in the school. " 
      p2="In the process of such education the parents have a great role to play. Children imitate their elders and try to behave just like them a they learn more from what we do than from what we say. Therefore, we should be careful in our behaviour, actions and speech, particularly in the presence of children. It is also advisable to encourage the child to develop a positive attitude in life by giving him success-experience. Another joint effort of home and school should be to hook the child on to reading. Let the child learn to read, and then he will read to learn."
        p3="Although high academic achievement is undoubtedly our endeavour, our goal is the development of the children total personality-self discipline, self-reliance, alertness, team work, concern for others, to be in harmony with nature, are some important traits we are trying to inculcate, and for which plenty of opportunity is being provided. Your support and encouragement to participate in the varied school activities will enable your ward to truly benefit from everything the school offers."
